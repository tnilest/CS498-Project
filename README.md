# CS498-Project
A repository to host our group's project files

Main branch is for the live product.
Dev is the development branch with the most up to date features.

# Guidelines
1. When editing always work on a branch separate from Main and Dev.
2. Don't change main or dev until your changes have been tested and approved by the rest of the group.
3. At our group meetings we will go over changes and merge them if they are ready.
4. Try to use descriptive commit messages, so that changes and issues have a clear history.
